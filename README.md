# Hi there, I'm Alice Caluisi ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ¼

I'm a passionate Physicist with an engineering background now working in data science, data engineering, and data analysis. I previously dedicated my efforts to a research project for my master's thesis at the ALICE experiment at CERN, focusing on the jets framework in Run3.

## ðŸŒŒ Professional Focus
- ðŸ’¼ **Current Role**: Engaged in data science, data engineering, and data analysis, applying my expertise to evaluate model performance predictions and manage financial data.
- ðŸ”¬ **Previous Research**: My master's thesis involved working with the ALICE experiment at CERN, specifically on extracting the strong coupling constant from the Lund Plane with jets in proton-proton collisions. This pioneering application of the Lund Plane to Run3 data was an exciting opportunity to explore potential new discoveries.

## ðŸ’» Contributions to the ALICE Experiment Analysis Framework

- ðŸŒ  **Run3 Jets Analysis**: As part of my master's thesis, I have actively contributed to O2Physics - the ALICE experiment analysis framework - focusing on the jets framework in Run3. Here are the links to my contributions:

  You can read more about my research results in my [Master final thesis](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/46251).
  
- âœ¨ **Run2 Azimuthal Correlation Functions**: During my CERN Summer School, I conducted research and contributed to the ALICE experiment analysis framework by studying the azimuthal correlation function of prompt D mesons with charged particles in Run2 data. I applied the Von Mises function for data fitting, providing valuable insights into particle behavior and interactions.

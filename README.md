# Hi there, I'm Alice Caluisi ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ¼

I'm a passionate Experimental Physics master's student at Utrecht University with a keen interest in Particle Physics, coding, and data analysis. Currently, I'm dedicated to my research project for my master's thesis at the ALICE experiment at CERN, focusing on the jets framework in Run3.

## ðŸŒŒ Research Focus

- ðŸ”¬ **Master's Thesis**: My current research project involves working with the ALICE experiment at CERN, specifically on extracting the strong coupling constant from the Lund Plane with jets in proton-proton collisions. What excites me most is that this pioneering application of the Lund Plane to Run3 data has never been done before. I'm thrilled about the potential discoveries that this approach can unveil.

## ðŸ’» Contributions to the ALICE Experiment Analysis Framework

- ðŸŒ  **Run3 Jets Analysis**: As part of my master's thesis, I actively contribute to O2Physics - the ALICE experiment analysis framework - focusing on the jets framework in Run3. Here is the link to the task I am working on now: [https://github.com/alicecaluisi/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGJE/Tasks/trackJetqa.cxx]. More to come next...ðŸ˜‰
  
- âœ¨ **Run2 Azimuthal Correlation Functions**: During my CERN Summer School, I conducted research and contributed to the ALICE experiment analysis framework by studying the azimuthal correlation function of prompt D mesons with charged particles in Run2 data. I applied the Von Mises function for data fitting, providing valuable insights into particle behavior and interactions. You can read more about my research results here: [Study of the azimuthal correlation function of prompt D mesons with charged particles using the Von Mises function for fitting the data](https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/node/35669)

# Hi there, I'm Alice Caluisi 😊🌼

I'm a passionate Physicist with an engineering background now working in data science, data engineering, and data analysis. I previously dedicated my efforts to a research project for my master's thesis at the ALICE experiment at CERN, focusing on the jets framework in Run3.

## 🌌 Professional Focus
- 💼 **Current Role**: Engaged in data science, data engineering, and data analysis, applying my expertise to evaluate model performance predictions and manage financial data.
- 🔬 **Previous Research**: My master's thesis involved working with the ALICE experiment at CERN, specifically on extracting the strong coupling constant from the Lund Plane with jets in proton-proton collisions. This pioneering application of the Lund Plane to Run3 data was an exciting opportunity to explore potential new discoveries.

## 🌙 Personal Project: Lunar Farming (work in progress)
Alongside my professional work, I am building **Lunar Farming**, a small project I am actively developing into a mobile app. The idea was born when I moved to my house in the countryside: I had a piece of land to cultivate, and so I started gardening with zero experience and, learning step by step (and through plenty of mistakes), I realized how relevant Moon phases can be when sowing and planning tasks in the garden. That’s when I decided to combine my passion for gardening, physics, and coding into a single project. As a physicist, I also wanted to build something that computes the lunar phase (instead of just reading it from a website) and turns it into practical, simple guidance.

**What Lunar Farming does (currently):**
- Computes **Moon age**, **illumination**, and the **lunar phase name**
- Provides **month-based gardening tips** depending on the Moon phase
- Exposes the data via a small **FastAPI JSON endpoint**, so it can be consumed by a frontend (which is in progress)

## 💻 Contributions to the ALICE Experiment Analysis Framework

- 🌠 **Run3 Jets Analysis**: As part of my master's thesis, I have actively contributed to O2Physics - the ALICE experiment analysis framework - focusing on the jets framework in Run3. Here are the links to my contributions:
  
  [Track Quality Assurance](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGJE/Tasks/trackJetqa.cxx)

  [Jet Lund Reclustering](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGJE/Tasks/jetLundReclustering.cxx)

  You can read more about my research results in my [Master final thesis](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/46251).
  
- ✨ **Run2 Azimuthal Correlation Functions**: During my CERN Summer School, I conducted research and contributed to the ALICE experiment analysis framework by studying the azimuthal correlation function of prompt D mesons with charged particles in Run2 data. I applied the Von Mises function for data fitting, providing valuable insights into particle behavior and interactions. You can read more about my research results here: [Study of the azimuthal correlation function of prompt D mesons with charged particles using the Von Mises function for fitting the data](https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/node/35669)
